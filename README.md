# Loading-Multiple-Files-In-Python
# Preface
At the start of every data science project the first objective is always to loading datasets. Having multiple files to load from my experience always brings about the question "How am I going to load all this data?"
# Data 
For this small project I am going to show an easy method to load 20 csv using python versus using an alternative like SSIS package.
# Loading Files 
## SSIS 
* Loading files with SSIS entails variables knowledge of the tool and SQL.
